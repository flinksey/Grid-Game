### Input
- M as number of rows
- N as number of cols
- K as boundary number (randomly generated values for the cells are within range(0,K))

### Output
- instructions (incl. those for input & game mechanics)
- score (set to zero initially)
- actual grid

### Components
I've tried to break this down as much as possible, so I can keep track of my progress as well as my approach.  
Will be adding more as I figure out how to go about this.

- [ ] lists for randomly generated cell values and for cell coordinates  
- [ ] dict for grid cells  
- [ ] grid generation (formatted)  
- [ ] function for handling match search  
- [ ] gravity function
